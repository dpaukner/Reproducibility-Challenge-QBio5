# Reproducibility-Challenge-QBio5
This code analyzes the species diversity data collected by LaMont Cole and compares it against a Poisson Distribution and a Langrangian Poisson Distribution. The code will plot the data for spiders, sowbugs, and weevils against the distributions . 

##Results
The data for spiders closely matches both the Poisson Distribution and Langrangian Poisson Distribution. Data for Sowbugs did not match the Poisson Distribution, but did match the Langrangian Poisson Distribution. Data for weevils matched the Poisson Distribution and the Langrangian Poisson Distribution.
